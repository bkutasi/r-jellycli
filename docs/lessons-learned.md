# Lessons Learned from Jellyfin Client Implementation

## Jellyfin API Insights

### Session Registration Requirements

1. **Correct Session Registration Flow**
   - **Problem**: Client did not appear in Jellyfin's "play on" menu despite correct capabilities reporting.
   - **Cause**: The sequence of operations for session initialization was incorrect.
   - **Solution**: Implemented the proper sequence for Jellyfin remote control registration:
     1. Report capabilities to server â†’ Get session ID
     2. Connect WebSocket with the session ID (critical)
     3. Start keep-alive pings

2. **Session ID Format**
   - **Problem**: Jellyfin requires a specific format for session IDs to properly recognize clients in the "play on" menu.
   - **Solution**: Adopted the session ID format from jellycli: `{client-name}_{device-name}_{uuid}` which is essential for remote control functionality.

3. **WebSocket Connection URL Format**
   - **Problem**: Jellyfin looks for the session ID in the WebSocket URL to associate the WebSocket connection with the session.
   - **Cause**: Our original implementation was missing the sessionId URL parameter in the WebSocket connection.
   - **Solution**: Added sessionId parameter to WebSocket URL: `socket?api_key={api_key}&deviceId={deviceId}&sessionId={sessionId}`

### Capabilities Reporting

1. **Capabilities JSON Structure**
   - **Problem**: Server rejected our capabilities with 400 Bad Request status.
   - **Cause**: Jellyfin API expects capabilities to be wrapped in a "capabilities" field.
   - **Solution**: Changed from structured `ClientCapabilitiesDto` to a simple map with all values inside a "capabilities" key.

2. **Command Naming Conventions**
   - **Problem**: Some command names in our implementation didn't match Jellyfin's expected values.
   - **Solution**: Updated command names to match Jellyfin expectations:
     - Changed `SetRepeat` to `SetRepeatMode`
     - Changed `SetShuffle` to `SetShuffleQueue`


### WebSocket State Reporting

1.  **Required Messages**:
    *   To make the client controllable and visible in the Jellyfin UI's "Now Playing" section, specific WebSocket messages must be sent *from* the client *to* the server.
    *   Key messages include `PlaybackStart`, `PlaybackStopped`, and `ReportPlaybackProgress`.

2.  **Progress Reporting**:
    *   `ReportPlaybackProgress` needs to be sent periodically (e.g., every few seconds) while playback is active.
    *   It requires the current playback position, typically in Ticks (10,000,000 ticks = 1 second). The `Player` needs a mechanism to get this information from the actual audio playback component (`AlsaPlayer`).

3.  **Decoupled Architecture Pattern**:
    *   Using asynchronous channels (like Tokio MPSC) to send state updates (`PlayerStateUpdate` enum) from the central `Player` to the `WebSocketHandler` works well.
    *   Using shared, thread-safe state (`Arc<StdMutex<...>>`) allows the low-level playback component (`AlsaPlayer`) to report its current position back to the `Player`'s progress reporting task without tight coupling.

4.  **Background Task Management**:
    *   The `Player` needs to manage background Tokio tasks for both audio playback and periodic progress reporting.
    *   Using broadcast channels for shutdown signals provides a clean way to terminate these tasks when playback stops or the application exits.

        5.  **Reporting via HTTP POST (Resolution for WebSocket Errors)**:
            *   **Problem**: Persistent `System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException` errors on the Jellyfin server side when receiving WebSocket messages like `PlaybackProgress`. The exact cause within the server's WebSocket handling remained elusive.
            *   **Solution**: Switched playback reporting (`PlaybackStart`, `PlaybackProgress`, `PlaybackStop`) from WebSocket messages to direct HTTP POST requests to the corresponding REST API endpoints (`/Sessions/Playing`, `/Sessions/Playing/Progress`, `/Sessions/Playing/Stopped`).
            *   **Outcome**: This completely resolved the server-side exceptions and proved to be a more robust method for state reporting in this case.

## Implementation Patterns from jellycli (Go)

1. **Device ID Generation**
   - **Adopted**: The device ID format uses a combination of client name, device name, and UUID for consistency.
   - **Implementation**: Consistent device ID across all communication with the server.

2. **WebSocket Connection Timing**
   - **Adopted**: Immediate WebSocket connection after capabilities reporting is essential for remote control registration.
   - **Implementation**: Established WebSocket connection immediately with session ID parameter.

3. **Keep-Alive Mechanism**
   - **Adopted**: Regular session pings (every 30 seconds) to maintain visibility in the "play on" menu.
   - **Implementation**: Background task for session keep-alive.

## Technical Implementation Challenges

## Audio Processing Lessons

        1.  **Sample Rate Mismatches (Resampling)**:
            *   **Problem**: Decoded audio stream's sample rate might not match the rate supported or configured for the ALSA output device, leading to playback speed issues or errors.
            *   **Solution**: Integrated the `rubato` crate (v0.14) for high-quality asynchronous audio resampling. The `FormatConverter` (`src/audio/format_converter.rs`) now uses `rubato` to convert the sample rate of the decoded audio chunks to match the ALSA device's target rate before writing.
            *   **Benefit**: Ensures correct playback speed regardless of source/sink rate differences.

        2.  **ALSA Underrun (EPIPE) Handling**:
            *   **Problem**: ALSA PCM writes can return an `EPIPE` (Broken pipe) error, indicating an underrun. The previous logic might incorrectly skip audio chunks after such a recoverable error.
            *   **Solution**: Implemented proper handling in `_write_to_alsa` (`src/audio/playback.rs`). When a recoverable underrun (`EPIPE`) occurs, the code now calls `pcm.recover(err.errno(), true)` and *retries* the write operation for the *same* chunk instead of discarding it.
            *   **Benefit**: Prevents audio data loss during recoverable underruns, leading to smoother playback.


        3.  **`rubato` Resampler API Nuances**:
            *   **Problem**: Build errors (E0599) occurred when trying to flush or process audio with `rubato`, especially when used with `Mutex`.
            *   **Lessons**:
                *   **Trait Scope**: The `rubato::Resampler` trait must be explicitly imported (`use rubato::Resampler;`) for its methods (like `process`) to be available.
                *   **Flushing**: The correct way to flush remaining samples from the resampler is `resampler.process(&[vec![]], None)?`, not a non-existent `process_last` method.
                *   **MutexGuard Dereferencing**: When the `Resampler` is held within a `Mutex`, the `MutexGuard` must be dereferenced (`&mut *guard`) before calling trait methods like `process`. Calling methods directly on the guard will fail as the guard itself doesn't implement the trait.
            *   **Benefit**: Understanding these specifics prevents common build errors and ensures correct interaction with the `rubato` library, particularly in concurrent contexts.

1. **Thread Safety Issues**
   - **Problem**: Box<dyn StdError> was not Send + Sync safe.
   - **Solution**: Properly wrapped errors in std::io::Error with string messages instead of passing raw dynamic error types.

2. **Method Visibility Issues**
   - **Problem**: Private start_keep_alive_pings method couldn't be called from outside the module.
   - **Solution**: Made the method public to allow proper session management.

3. **Unused Variable Warnings**
   - **Problem**: Various unused variables in the session implementation.
   - **Solution**: Prefixed unused variables with underscores to maintain code clarity.


        4. **Asynchronous Cleanup and `Drop` Trait Issues**:
           *   **Problem**: Performing potentially blocking operations (like `blocking_lock()` on a `Mutex` or joining threads/tasks) within a `Drop` implementation for asynchronous structures (like `PlaybackOrchestrator` or `Player`) can lead to panics, especially when the Tokio runtime is shutting down. `Drop` is synchronous and doesn't integrate well with async cleanup needs.
           *   **Solution**: Refactored cleanup logic into a dedicated `async fn shutdown(&mut self)` method within the relevant structs (`Player`, `PlaybackOrchestrator`). This method is called explicitly *before* the struct is dropped (e.g., before exiting `main`).
           *   **Benefit**: Ensures graceful and non-blocking cleanup of resources (stopping tasks, releasing locks) within the async context, preventing shutdown panics.
## Failed Simplification Attempts

1.  **Removing SSDP & Aligning with `jellycli-repo`**
    *   **Attempt**: Simplified the client by removing the SSDP broadcaster, HTTP keep-alive pings, and refactoring session/ID handling to closely mimic the `jellycli-repo` (Go reference client).
    *   **Outcome**: Failed. The client still did not appear in the Jellyfin "play on" menu.
    *   **Lesson**: Simply removing SSDP and aligning session handling with the Go client was insufficient. This suggests either SSDP *is* required (or contributes in a necessary way), or the core visibility issue lies elsewhere (e.g., subtle WebSocket behavior differences, server-side configuration/bugs, or other undiscovered factors). The simplification did not isolate the root cause.


## General Learning Points

1. **API Documentation Interpretation**
   - Different API endpoints might require different payload structures despite similar purposes.
   - Careful review of HTTP status codes (204 No Content is a positive response in this case).

2. **WebSocket Protocol for Remote Control**
   - WebSocket connections require synchronized timing with HTTP requests.
   - Session identification must be consistent across different connection types.

3. **Rust-specific Lessons**
   - Mutex wrapping is needed for shared data between threads.
   - Error types must implement Send + Sync for thread-safe error handling.
   - Tokio's spawn function requires 'static lifetime for all moved values.
