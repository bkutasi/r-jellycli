# Active Development Context

**Current Focus**: Enhance Client Identification and Audio Playback Integration

**Status**:
- âœ… **Audio Playback Fixes**
  - Implemented support for multiple audio formats (S16, F32, U8, S24, S32)
  - Fixed format conversion using proper Symphonia API methods
  - Added graceful fallback for unsupported formats
  - Configured ALSA for proper integration with CamillaDSP (`hw:Loopback,0,0`)
  - Fixed "Resource busy" issues with proper device selection
  - Documented ALSA configuration options in the README

- âœ… **Documentation Updates**
  - Updated README with ALSA configuration details
  - Updated error documentation with new troubleshooting tips
  - Added lessons learned about audio format handling
  - Created comprehensive memory of implemented audio playback fixes
  - Updated README with new clean exit functionality

- âœ… **User Experience Improvements**
  - Implemented clean exit handling with Ctrl+C support
  - Added exit functionality at all navigation points
  - Fixed signal handling to ensure graceful shutdown
  - Ensured background tasks are properly terminated during exit

- ðŸš§ **Current Blockers**
  - Client appears as generic "CLI" in other Jellyfin clients instead of a proper named session
  - Session management may not be optimal for keeping active status

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement proper client identification to appear as an active named session in other Jellyfin clients
2. Add session ping/keep-alive mechanism to maintain active status
3. Continue refining audio playback with additional format optimizations
4. Implement proper error handling for network disruptions during playback
