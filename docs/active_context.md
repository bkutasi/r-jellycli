# Active Development Context

**Current Focus**: Jellyfin Remote Control Integration and Session Visibility

**Status**:
- ✅ **Audio Playback Fixes**
  - Implemented support for multiple audio formats (S16, F32, U8, S24, S32)
  - Fixed format conversion using proper Symphonia API methods
  - Added graceful fallback for unsupported formats
  - Configured ALSA for proper integration with CamillaDSP (`hw:Loopback,0,0`)
  - Fixed "Resource busy" issues with proper device selection
  - Documented ALSA configuration options in the README

- ✅ **Documentation Updates**
  - Updated README with ALSA configuration details
  - Created comprehensive `lessons-learned.mdc` document for Jellyfin integration insights
  - Documented session management requirements for remote control functionality
  - Added error handling patterns for thread-safe operation

- ✅ **User Experience Improvements**
  - Implemented clean exit handling with Ctrl+C support
  - Added exit functionality at all navigation points
  - Fixed signal handling to ensure graceful shutdown
  - Ensured background tasks are properly terminated during exit

- ✅ **Jellyfin Remote Control Integration & Stable WebSocket**
  - Implemented proper client capability reporting format.
  - Established a stable and persistent WebSocket connection immediately after capabilities reporting, using the correct session ID.
  - Session keep-alive pings (every 30 seconds) successfully maintain the connection and session visibility.
  - Resolved previous error handling and thread safety issues related to the WebSocket connection.
  - Ensured `DeviceId` is correctly generated/loaded and used for session reporting.
  - The client now reliably appears in Jellyfin's "Play On" menu thanks to the stable connection.

- ✅ **SSDP Discovery Implementation**
  - Added an asynchronous SSDP broadcasting task (`src/ssdp/broadcaster.rs`).
  - Integrated the task into the main application flow (`src/main.rs`).
  - Added logging to the SSDP task for monitoring.
  - Corrected compilation errors related to SSDP integration and `DeviceId` handling.

- ❌ **Failed Simplification Attempt**: Removed SSDP broadcaster, HTTP pings, and refactored session/ID handling to align with `jellycli-repo`. This did *not* resolve the client visibility issue.

- ✅ **Blockers Resolved**
  - The previous blocker regarding client visibility in the "Play On" menu is resolved due to the stable WebSocket connection.

**Next Steps**:
1.  Focus on the next high-priority tasks from `docs/tasks_plan.md`, such as implementing real streaming/decoding or enhancing playback controls.
2.  Perform thorough testing of remote control commands now that the WebSocket connection is stable.
3.  Continue refining error handling and documentation based on recent changes.
